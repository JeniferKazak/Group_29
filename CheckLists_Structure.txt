A checklist is a set of ideas that are logically related.
We can create checklists for:
-typical user scenarios,
-different levels of functional testing,
-individual parts (modules and submodules) of the application,
-individual requirements, groups of requirements, levels and types of requirements,
-the parts or functions of the application that are most at risk.
